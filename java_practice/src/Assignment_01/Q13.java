 * Q13. How Compiler And Jvm Can Differentiate Constructor And Method
         Definitions Of Both Have Same Class Name?
        
        -In java every method have a return type
          but constructor does not any return type
          This is the way java runtime distinguish between a normal method and a constructor.
          if we place a return type in constructor the it becomes the method
