 *  Q19. Why we cannot create a private and protected class in Java?
 *       
 *   - In java, we can create inner class as private or protected class but
 *     - We can not create outer class as private and protected class in java because 
 *       if a class is private then it accessibility is within class
 *       and if class is protected then its accessibility is with in a package or outside the package through inheritance
 *       hence if class created as private and protected the JVM can not access these classes and program  can not be compiled or executed
 *       JVM is not written in a way so that it will inherit class for protected accessibility
