 * Q20. What happens if we add final keyword with Class, Method and a variable in java.
 *      
 *      -add final keyword with a class
 *          - if we add a final keyword in class means now we can not inherited that class.
 *        
 *      -add final keyword with a method
 *          - if we add a final keyword with a method means now we can not override or redefine that method.
 *         
 *      -add final keyword with a variable
 *          - if we add final keyword with a variable means now we can not change the value of that variable
 *            adding final keywords to variable means making that variable as constant
